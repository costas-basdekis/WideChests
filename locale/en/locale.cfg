[mod-setting-description]
WideChests_max-chest-width=Maximum width of merged chest. Install WideChestsUnlimited mod if you want limit to be higher than 42.
WideChests_max-chest-height=Maximum height of merged chest. Install WideChestsUnlimited mod if you want limit to be higher than 42.
WideChests_max-chest-area=Maximum area of merged chest. Install WideChestsUnlimited mod if you want limit to be higher than 1600.
WideChests_inventory-size-multiplier=Merged chest's inventory size is sum of inventory sizes of individual merged chests. This number is than multiplied by this setting.
WideChests_inventory-size-limit=Maximum inventory size a merged chest can have. Normally merged chest's inventory size is sum of inventory sizes of individual merged chests (and then multiplied by above multiplier).
WideChests_sprite-decal-chance=Percent chance of decals (graphical variety) to appear on merged chests. So far only warehouses (merged chests with both sides larger between 1 and "Warehouse size threshold") have decals.
WideChests_warehouse-threshold=Trashdump will be used when merging area larger than X on both sides.
WideChests_whitelist-chest-sizes=Specified which chests are enabled. It's a list of values like 'AxB' separated by space, 'A' and 'B' can either be a integer (greater than 0) or 'N' that represent a wildcard (meaning it will match everything). For example, "1x6 2x4 13xN" will only allow 1x6, 2x4, 13x1, 13x2, 13x3, 13x4, etc... chests to be mergeable. Default 'NxN' allow anything (so up to 42x42 by default).
WideChests_mirror-whitelists=When enabled you don't have to specify both "AxB" and "BxA". Either one of them will work as both of them.
WideChests_circuit-connector-position=Specifies where the circuit connector will be placed on the merged chests.
WideChests_allow-delete-items=Allows deleting items during merging or splitting of chests.
